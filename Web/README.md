Web based keyboards
====

One of the web based Chuvash keyboards is jQuery IME, it is a Wikimedia project. [Chuvash](https://github.com/wikimedia/jquery.ime/tree/master/rules/cv) is also present there. 

A nice thing is an extension for Chrome and Firefox. It can be used to type Chuvash in any textbox.
