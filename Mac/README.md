# Chuvash Keyboard Layout for Mac OS
Chuvash Keyboard Layout (Input Source) is created using Ukulele according the steps described in [Salvatore Testas blog post](https://saltesta.com/hack/customizing-mac-input-source-icon/).

The layout is the same as the one for Windows. Instead of AltGR, on Mac we can use Option (left and right) to type ӐӑӖӗҪҫӲӳ.
